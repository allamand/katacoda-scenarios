In this scenario we explored how to use a Docker Swarm Cluster, how applications are spreading in it, and how to use docker-compose to manage your deployments, and a loadBalancer/Proxy such as Traefik to dynamically adapt routing rules according on dockers you launch on the cluster..

>To run this in production, some of the tooling will be different to adapt on multi-tenancy concern and security.

This course is just for you to see how the basic technologies are working one with each others, please share it If you like it.
